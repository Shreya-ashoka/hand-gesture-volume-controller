Report on Hand Gesture Volume Controller using Python
numpy will help us work with arrays
pip install numpy
opencv-python:We will import this library as cv2. We will use it to capture an image using the webcam and convert it to RGB.
pip install opencv-python
mediapipe:It is an open-source library developed by Google. We use it for both face and gesture recognition. For this tutorial, we’ll use it for hand gesture recognition
pip install mediapipe
pycaw:We’ll need this library to access the device’s speaker and its master volume
pip install pycaw
python-math:We’ll use this library to find the distance between point number 4 (the thumb) and point number 8 (the index finger) using hypotenuse.
pip install python-math
gpib-ctypes, comtypes:pycaw depends on these two libraries. Ctypes provides C language compatible data types. Comtypes bases on the ctypes FFI(Foreign Function Interface) library.
pip install gpib-ctypes, comtypes
